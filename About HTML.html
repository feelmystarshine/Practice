    <h2>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language for creating web pages and web applications. HTML describes the structure and content of a web page using a series of elements, which are tags that enclose or wrap different parts of the document. HTML elements can have attributes, which are additional information that modify or specify the behavior or appearance of the element. HTML elements can also contain text, images, links, forms, tables, lists, and other types of content that make up a web page.</h2>
    <h2>HTML is not a programming language, but a markup language that defines the meaning and purpose of the content, rather than how it looks or behaves. HTML is usually paired with other technologies, such as CSS and JavaScript, to style and add interactivity to the web page. CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a language that describes how HTML elements are displayed on the screen, such as their color, font, size, position, layout, and animation. JavaScript, which stands for JavaScript, is a scripting language that enables dynamic and interactive features on the web page, such as validating user input, manipulating the HTML document, fetching data from a server, or creating animations and games.</h2>
    <h2>HTML has evolved over the years, with new versions introducing new features and deprecating old ones. The current version of HTML is HTML5, which was published in 2014 and is supported by all modern browsers. HTML5 introduced new elements and attributes that enhance the semantics, accessibility, and functionality of web pages, such as:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>header tag, nav tag, section tag, article tag, aside tag, and footer tag: These elements define the different parts of a web page, such as the header, navigation, main content, sidebar, and footer, and help organize the document in a meaningful way.</li>
            <li> hgroup, figure, figcaption tag, details tag, summary tag, and mark tag: These elements provide additional information and context for the content, such as grouping headings, adding captions to images, creating collapsible sections, and highlighting important text.</li>
                <li>audio, video, source, track, and canvas: These elements enable the embedding and manipulation of multimedia content, such as audio, video, and graphics, without the need for external plugins or libraries.</li>
                    <li>form, input, output, label, select, option, textarea, button, and datalist: These elements allow the creation and submission of forms, which are used to collect user input, such as text, numbers, dates, files, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdown lists, and more.</li>
                    <li>a tag, link, img, map, area, and iframe: These elements enable the creation and display of links, images, image maps, and inline frames, which are used to connect and embed different web pages and resources.</li>
                    <li>div, span, p, br, hr, and pre: These elements define the basic formatting and layout of the content, such as creating divisions, spans, paragraphs, line breaks, horizontal rules, and preformatted text.</li>
    </ul>
