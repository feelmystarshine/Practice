    <h3>CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a language that describes how HTML elements are displayed on the screen, such as their color, font, size, position, layout, and animation. CSS allows web designers and developers to create and customize the appearance and behavior of web pages, and to separate the presentation from the structure and content of the document.</h3>
    <h3>CSS has three main components: selectors, properties, and values. A selector is a pattern that matches one or more HTML elements, and specifies which elements the CSS rules apply to. A property is a name that defines a specific aspect of the element’s appearance, such as background-color, font-family, or margin. A value is a data type that specifies the property’s setting, such as red, Arial, or 10px. A CSS rule is a combination of a selector and one or more property-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces. For example, the following CSS rule sets the text color of all paragraphs to blue:</h3>
    <h3>CSS can be added to HTML in three ways: inline, internal, or external. Inline CSS is written directly in the HTML element’s style attribute, and affects only that element. Internal CSS is written in the HTML document’s head section, inside a style element, and affects the whole document. External CSS is written in a separate file, with a .css extension, and linked to the HTML document using a link element, and can affect multiple documents. The recommended way to use CSS is external, as it allows better organization, reusability, and maintenance of the code.</h3>
    <h3>CSS has evolved over the years, with new versions introducing new features and deprecating old ones. The current version of CSS is CSS3, which is not a single specification, but a collection of modules that cover different aspects of web design and development, such as:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Selectors: These modules define new and advanced selectors that allow more precise and flexible targeting of HTML elements, such as attribute, pseudo-class, pseudo-element, and combinator selectors.</li>
        <li>Box Model: These modules define how the layout and dimensions of HTML elements are calculated and rendered, such as margin, padding, border, width, height, and overflow properties.</li>
        <li>Backgrounds and Borders: These modules define how the background and border of HTML elements are styled and manipulated, such as background-image, background-size, background-position, border-radius, border-image, and box-shadow properties.</li>
        <li>Text Effects: These modules define how the text and fonts of HTML elements are styled and manipulated, such as text-align, text-decoration, text-transform, font-size, font-family, font-weight, and @font-face properties.</li>
        <li>2D/3D Transformations: These modules define how HTML elements are transformed in two or three dimensions, such as rotate, scale, skew, translate, and perspective functions.</li>
        <li>Transitions: These modules define how HTML elements change their properties smoothly over time, such as transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay properties.</li>
        <li>Animations: These modules define how HTML elements move or change their properties over time, using keyframes and animation properties, such as animation-name, animation-duration, animation-timing-function, animation-delay, and animation-iteration-count properties.</li>
        <li>Flexbox: This module defines a new layout mode that allows HTML elements to be arranged in a flexible and responsive way, using flex container and flex item properties, such as display, flex-direction, flex-wrap, justify-content, align-items, and align-content properties.</li>
        <li>Grid: This module defines a new layout mode that allows HTML elements to be arranged in a grid-like structure, using grid container and grid item properties, such as display, grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, grid-gap, grid-area, and grid-template-areas properties.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>CSS is a powerful and versatile language that enables web designers and developers to create and customize the look and feel of web pages, and to adapt them to different devices, screen sizes, and user preferences. CSS is easy to learn, as it uses a simple and intuitive syntax, and does not require any special software or tools. CSS is also flexible and modular, as it can be combined with other languages and technologies, such as HTML, JavaScript, and preprocessors, to create rich and interactive web experiences. CSS is a universal and open standard, as it can be used across different platforms, devices, and browsers, and is supported by a large and active community of web developers and enthusiasts.</h3>
